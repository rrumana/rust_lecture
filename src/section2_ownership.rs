//! Section 2: Ownership and Move Semantics
//! =======================================
//! 
//! This section demonstrates Rust's unique ownership system:
//! - Ownership rules and scope
//! - Move semantics vs Copy semantics
//! - Function ownership transfer
//! - Memory safety without garbage collection
